Digital Clock
This is a simple digital clock implemented in JavaScript.

Usage
Clone the repository or download the index.html and script.js files.
Open index.html in your web browser.
Features
Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
Updates every second to show the accurate time.
How It Works
The script uses the Date object in JavaScript to get the current time. It then formats the time into hours, minutes, and seconds, and updates the HTML content of a specified element with the formatted time. The clock updates every second using setInterval.
